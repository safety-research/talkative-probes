# LLaMA Compatibility for Multi-Layer Patching

## Overview
Successfully extended the multi-layer patching implementation to support LLaMA-style models (like SimpleStories) in addition to GPT-2 style models.

## Key Changes

### 1. Architecture Detection
The decoder now automatically detects the model architecture:
- **GPT-2 style**: Has `.transformer` attribute with `.h` layers and `.ln_f` final norm
- **LLaMA style**: Has `.model` attribute with `.layers` and `.norm` final norm

### 2. Rotary Position Embeddings
LLaMA models use rotary position embeddings that must be computed and passed to each layer:
```python
# For LLaMA models, compute rotary embeddings before layer loop
if hasattr(main_base, 'model') and hasattr(transformer, 'rotary_emb'):
    cos, sin = transformer.rotary_emb(hidden_states, position_ids)
    position_embeddings = (cos, sin)
```

### 3. Layer Calling Convention
Different architectures require different arguments:
- **GPT-2**: `layer(hidden_states, position_ids=position_ids)`
- **LLaMA**: `layer(hidden_states, position_ids=position_ids, position_embeddings=position_embeddings)`

### 4. Updated Methods
All generation methods now support both architectures:
- `generate_soft` ✓
- `generate_soft_chkpt` ✓  
- `generate_soft_kv_cached` ✓

## Testing
Comprehensive tests verify:
1. Both architectures work with multi-layer patching
2. Gradients flow correctly for both single and per-layer projections
3. Different generation methods produce consistent results
4. No off-by-one errors in embed position calculation

## Usage
No changes required to the API. The decoder automatically handles the architecture differences:

```python
# Works for both GPT-2 and LLaMA models
config = DecoderConfig(
    model_name="SimpleStories/SimpleStories-5M",  # or "gpt2"
    patch_all_layers=True,
    per_layer_projections=True,
)
decoder = Decoder(config)
```

## Performance
- Architecture detection adds minimal overhead
- Rotary embeddings are computed once per generation step
- Memory usage and speed are comparable between architectures
