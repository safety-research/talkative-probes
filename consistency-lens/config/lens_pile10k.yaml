  # HuggingFace dataset loading options
  # If 'use_hf_dataset' is true the dumper script will read the tiny 10-k subset of
  # The Pile instead of the built-in toy prompts. Useful once the smoke test passes
  # and we want more realistic activations.
  # NOTE: the dumper currently loads the entire split into RAM; see TODO in the
  #       script about switching to streaming=True for larger datasets.
  # future option â€“ not yet consumed by the script
