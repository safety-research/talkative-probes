# Multi-Layer Patching Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented multi-layer patching functionality for the Consistency Lens decoder, allowing activations to be patched into all transformer layers simultaneously rather than just after the embedding layer.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Configuration Options
Added two new options to `DecoderConfig`:
- `patch_all_layers`: When True, patches the activation at every transformer layer
- `per_layer_projections`: When True, uses a separate projection matrix for each layer

### 2. Projection Layer Architecture
- **Single projection mode**: Uses one projection matrix for all layers (when `per_layer_projections=False`)
- **Per-layer projection mode**: Uses a 3D tensor of shape `(n_layers, d_model, d_model)` with separate projections per layer
- Both modes initialize as identity matrices by default

### 3. Patching Behavior
- **Original behavior** (`patch_all_layers=False`): Inserts projected activation as a token after embeddings
- **Multi-layer patching** (`patch_all_layers=True`): Replaces hidden state at the embed position after each transformer layer
  - For single projection: Computes projection once and reuses
  - For per-layer projections: Applies layer-specific projection at each layer
  - Layer 0 uses its projection for the initial token insertion

### 4. Implementation Details
- The activation is replaced at position `embed_pos` (after left prompt tokens)
- Replacement happens AFTER each layer computes its output
- All generation methods support multi-layer patching:
  - `generate_soft`: ✓ Fully working
  - `generate_soft_chkpt`: ✓ Works for non-multi-layer patching (TODO: fix for multi-layer)
  - `generate_soft_kv_cached`: ✓ Works for non-multi-layer patching (TODO: fix for multi-layer)
  - `generate_soft_kv_flash`: Not tested but should work similarly

## Gradient Flow
- Gradients flow correctly through all layers (except layer 11)
- Layer 11 (last layer) has zero gradient due to causal masking - this is expected behavior
- The embed position doesn't directly influence future generated tokens due to causal attention

## Testing
Comprehensive tests verify:
1. All generation methods produce identical outputs (for supported configurations)
2. Gradients flow correctly with respect to inputs and parameters
3. Per-layer projections receive appropriate gradients
4. Integration with encoder-decoder pipeline works correctly

## Known Limitations
1. **Gradient checkpointing**: Currently disabled for multi-layer patching due to closure issues
2. **KV caching**: Implementation incomplete for multi-layer patching
3. **Layer 11 gradients**: Always zero due to causal structure (this is correct behavior)

## Usage Example
```python
# Single projection for all layers
config = DecoderConfig(
    model_name="gpt2",
    patch_all_layers=True,
    per_layer_projections=False,
)

# Per-layer projections
config = DecoderConfig(
    model_name="gpt2", 
    patch_all_layers=True,
    per_layer_projections=True,
)
```
