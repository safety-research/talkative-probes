# Critical Device-Aware Kernel Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The systematic corruption on rank 1 (GPU 1) was caused by **incorrect device context handling** in the Triton kernel caching and optimization system. The kernels were being compiled and cached based on `torch.cuda.current_device()` rather than the actual device where tensors were located.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Kernel Cache Key Issue**: The `_get_kernel_cache_key()` function was using `torch.cuda.current_device()` which doesn't necessarily match the device of tensors being processed
2. **Device Properties Mismatch**: Optimization flags were computed using properties from the wrong device 
3. **SM Count Mismatch**: The number of SMs was obtained from current device rather than tensor device
4. **Cross-Device Kernel Reuse**: Kernels compiled for device 0 were incorrectly reused on device 1

## Files Modified

### 1. `/triton_kernels/matmul_ogs.py`
- **Fixed `_get_kernel_cache_key()`**: Now accepts device parameter and uses actual tensor device
- **Fixed `get_kernels()`**: Passes device parameter through the call chain
- **Fixed device capability check**: Uses tensor device instead of current device
- **Fixed SM count retrieval**: Passes device to `target_info.num_sms()`
- **Updated kernel calls**: Pass `x.device` to ensure correct kernel selection

### 2. `/triton_kernels/matmul_ogs_details/opt_flags.py`
- **Fixed `make_opt_flags()`**: Accepts device parameter and propagates it
- **Fixed device property access**: Uses provided device_id instead of current_device
- **Updated function signatures**: Added device_key parameter to make_default_opt_flags_*

### 3. `/triton_kernels/matmul_ogs_details/opt_flags_details/opt_flags_nvidia.py`
- **Fixed `compute_split_k()`**: Accepts device_id parameter
- **Fixed `compute_num_stages()`**: Accepts device_id parameter
- **Updated device property calls**: Use provided device_id

### 4. `/triton_kernels/target_info.py`
- **Fixed `num_sms()`**: Accepts device parameter to get SM count for specific device

## Key Changes Summary

### Before (Broken)
```python
# Used current device, not tensor device
device_id = torch.cuda.current_device()
cache_key = (device_id, ...)
n_sms = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(device_id).multi_processor_count
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
# Use actual tensor device
if device is not None:
    device_id = device.index if device.type == 'cuda' else 0
cache_key = (device_id, ...)
n_sms = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(device_id).multi_processor_count
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive test script (`test_device_aware_fix.py`) that verifies:
1. Correct cache key generation per device
2. Proper kernel module retrieval per device
3. Successful execution on each GPU
4. No NaN/Inf values in results
5. Correct device placement of results

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
- Each GPU uses kernels compiled specifically for its architecture
- Device properties are correctly queried for the target device
- Kernel caching is properly isolated per device
- Multi-GPU inference works correctly without corruption

## Verification
All 8 GPUs tested successfully:
- Sequential tests: ✅ PASSED
- Parallel tests: ✅ PASSED  
- No corruption on rank 1 or any other rank
- Results are numerically valid (no NaN/Inf)

## Important Notes
1. This was a critical bug that would affect ANY multi-GPU setup
2. The fix maintains backward compatibility for single-GPU setups
3. Thread-safe kernel caching is preserved
4. Performance characteristics are unchanged

## Recommendation
These changes should be merged upstream to the Triton kernels library as they fix a fundamental multi-GPU correctness issue.
