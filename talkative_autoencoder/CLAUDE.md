# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Natural Language Autoencoders** (also known as **Talkative Autoencoders**) is a scalable method for interpreting Large Language Models by forcing internal neural states through a human-readable textual bottleneck. The system trains an autoencoder that converts LLM activations to text explanations and back, testing whether reconstructed activations preserve functional behavior.

### Training Objective

- **Primary Goal**: MSE divergence measures reconstruction
## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
cd consistency-lens
make  # One-time setup: installs uv and configures shared cache
```

Submit to SLURM/run directly with ./scripts/submit_with_config.sh, passing the hydra config+some additional args in hydra formatting.

This project uses `uv` for seamless multi-node Python environment management. When you first use `uv run` on a new node, it will automatically create the environment for that node.

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/

# Using torchrun for distributed training
uv run torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/01_train_distributed.py
```
**Performance Note**: First `uv run` on a new node will be slower (~1-2 min) as it installs PyTorch and other packages. Subsequent runs are instant.


# Training creates run-specific output directories like: outputs/5M_L5_SimpleStories_lr1e-4_t10_1222_1430/

# Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

  When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
  context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

  ## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

  Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
   gemini command:

  ### Examples:

  **Single file analysis:**
  ```bash
  gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

  Multiple files:
  gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

  Entire directory:
  gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

  Multiple directories:
  gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

  Current directory and subdirectories:
  gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"

#
 Or use --all_files flag:
  gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"

  Implementation Verification Examples

  Check if a feature is implemented:
  gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"

  Verify authentication implementation:
  gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"

  Check for specific patterns:
  gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"

  Verify error handling:
  gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"

  Check for rate limiting:
  gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"

  Verify caching strategy:
  gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"

  Check for specific security measures:
  gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"

  Verify test coverage for features:
  gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"

  When to Use Gemini CLI

  Use gemini -p when:
  - Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
  - Comparing multiple large files
  - Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
  - Current context window is insufficient for the task
  - Working with files totaling more than 100KB
  - Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
  - Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

  Important Notes

  - Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
  - The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
  - No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
  - Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
  - When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results # Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

  Finally: when you prompt Gemini, do not claim it is your work. Gemini will often be sycophantic if you do this. Ask for a review of this code/plan written by a colleague - don't imply you wrote it yourself!
