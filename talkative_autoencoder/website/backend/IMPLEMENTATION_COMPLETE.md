# Unified Multi-GPU Implementation Complete

## Summary

I have successfully implemented a unified multi-GPU architecture for the talkative autoencoder backend that treats single-GPU deployments as a special case of multi-GPU, eliminating the need for separate code paths and backward compatibility shims.

## Key Files Created/Modified

### 1. **`model_manager.py`** (New)
- Implements `UnifiedModelManager` class
- Treats all models as part of groups (single-model groups for standalone models)
- Device management using string identifiers (`cuda:0`, `cuda:1`, etc.)
- Smart model placement and routing
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

### 2. **`unified_api.py`** (New)
- Clean API design at `/api/v2/`
- Optional `device_id` parameter in all endpoints
- Unified handling of single and multi-GPU deployments
- Backward compatibility endpoints marked as deprecated

### 3. **`main.py`** (Modified)
- Updated imports to use `UnifiedModelManager` instead of `GroupedModelManager`
- Simplified startup logic - no special handling for single vs multi-GPU
- Updated WebSocket handlers to use unified system

## API Design

### Core Endpoints

1. **Load Model**
   ```
   POST /api/v2/models/load
   {
       "model_id": "gemma-2b",
       "device_id": 0  // Optional - auto-selects if omitted
   }
   ```

2. **Process Prompt**
   ```
   POST /api/v2/models/process
   {
       "model_id": "gemma-2b",
       "prompt": "Analyze this text",
       "num_predictions": 3,
       "device_id": null  // Optional
   }
   ```

3. **System State**
   ```
   GET /api/v2/system/state
   // Returns complete system state with all devices and models
   ```

4. **Load Group**
   ```
   POST /api/v2/groups/load
   {
       "group_id": "gemma-models",
       "device_id": 1  // Optional
   }
   ```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Single code path for all deployments
2. **Scalability**: Seamless scaling from 1 to N GPUs
3. **Efficiency**: Smart device selection and model placement
4. **Maintainability**: No duplicate code or compatibility layers

## WebSocket Protocol

The unified WebSocket provides real-time updates:
- `connection_established`: Initial connection with device count
- `system_state`: Full system state on connect
- `state_update`: Broadcast on any change
- `model_loaded`, `device_cleared`, etc.: Specific event notifications

## Implementation Notes

1. **Device Identifiers**: Uses string format (`cuda:0`) internally, but API accepts integers for compatibility
2. **Model Groups**: All models belong to groups; single models get auto-generated single-model groups
3. **Memory Management**: Tracks memory per device and makes intelligent placement decisions
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when preferred devices are unavailable

## Testing

While I couldn't fully test the implementation due to environment setup timeouts, the code is structured to:
- Handle import errors gracefully
- Work with the existing `LensAnalyzer` infrastructure
- Maintain compatibility with the `InferenceService`

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation in the actual deployment environment
2. Update frontend to use the new `/api/v2/` endpoints
3. Remove legacy code once migration is verified
4. Add advanced features like:
   - Model pinning to specific devices
   - Cross-device model sharding for very large models
   - Dynamic load balancing based on request patterns

## Migration Guide

For clients migrating to the new API:
- Single-GPU users: No changes needed, just use new endpoints without `device_id`
- Multi-GPU users: Add `device_id` where specific placement is needed
- WebSocket clients: Update to handle new message types

The implementation provides a clean, scalable foundation for both current single-GPU deployments and future multi-GPU scaling.
