# Final Implementation Summary - Grouped Model Management

## Core Concept
Models that share a base model (e.g., multiple Gemma 2 9B checkpoints with different lens weights) can share the large transformer model in memory, switching only the small lens components.

## Correct Implementation Pattern

### First Model in Group (establishes shared resources):
```python
# Load first model - this creates the shared base
analyzer1 = LensAnalyzer(
    checkpoint_path_1,
    device=device,
    # ... other params
)

# Extract and cache the shared resources
shared_base_model = analyzer1.shared_base_model  # The actual transformer
orig_model_wrapper = analyzer1.orig_model        # The OrigWrapper instance
```

### Subsequent Models in Same Group (reuse shared resources):
```python
# Load second model - reuses shared base
analyzer2 = LensAnalyzer(
    checkpoint_path_2,
    device=device,
    shared_base_model=shared_base_model,  # Pass the actual model object
    different_activations_orig=orig_model_wrapper,  # Pass cached wrapper (or path)
    # ... other params
    # NO old_lens needed for web app
)
```

## Key Implementation Points

1. **shared_base_model**: Must be the actual transformer model (`analyzer.shared_base_model`), NOT the analyzer itself

2. **orig_model caching**: Cache `OrigWrapper` instances to avoid recreating them. These wrap the model used for generating activations.

3. **different_activations_orig**: Can be either:
   - A cached `OrigWrapper` instance (preferred for memory efficiency)
   - A string path (LensAnalyzer will create a new wrapper)

4. **Device management**: When moving groups between CPU/GPU, must move:
   - The shared_base_model
   - All cached analyzers in the group
   - Any associated orig_model wrappers

5. **NO old_lens**: This parameter is specific to notebook reloading scenarios and not needed for the web app

## Memory Savings Example

For Gemma 2 9B variants:
- Base model size: ~20GB
- Lens checkpoint size: ~1-2GB

Without sharing:
- Model 1: 20GB + 1GB = 21GB
- Model 2: 20GB + 1GB = 21GB
- Total: 42GB

With sharing:
- Shared base: 20GB
- Model 1 lens: 1GB
- Model 2 lens: 1GB
- Total: 22GB (20GB saved!)

## Integration Checklist

✅ GroupedModelManager stores actual transformer models in `shared_base_models`
✅ OrigWrapper instances are cached in `shared_orig_models`
✅ Device movement includes all components
✅ No old_lens parameter used
✅ Frontend shows grouped models with fast-switch indicators
✅ API supports both grouped and legacy endpoints

## Testing Recommendations

1. Load two models from the same group and verify:
   - Second load is much faster (~10s vs ~1min)
   - GPU memory doesn't double
   - Both models work correctly

2. Switch between groups and verify:
   - Previous group moves to CPU
   - New group loads to GPU
   - Memory is properly managed

3. Test edge cases:
   - Models with different `different_activations_orig` in same group
   - Switching rapidly between models
   - Loading when GPU memory is nearly full
