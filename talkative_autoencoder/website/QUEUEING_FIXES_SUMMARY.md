# Analysis Queueing System Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the critical fixes made to the analysis queueing system to support multiple concurrent analyses from the same session.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Race Condition in Request ID Assignment**
- **Problem**: Multiple rapid submissions could get mismatched request IDs
- **Solution**: Implemented client-generated `client_request_id` system where frontend creates unique IDs for each analysis

### 2. **Wrong Request Being Cancelled**
- **Problem**: `interruptComputation` used global `state.currentRequestId` instead of specific request IDs
- **Solution**: Created `interruptSpecificRequest` function that uses the specific `request_id` from each generation

### 3. **Analysis Results Being Ignored**
- **Problem**: Code checked if incoming `request_id` matched `state.currentRequestId` and ignored mismatches
- **Solution**: Removed this check entirely since we support multiple concurrent analyses

### 4. **Tabs Showing in Wrong Order**
- **Problem**: FIFO fallback was matching results to wrong pending tabs when analyses completed out of order
- **Solution**: Removed unsafe FIFO fallback and use strict `client_request_id` matching

### 5. **Pending Tabs Not Updating**
- **Problem**: Pending tabs remained stuck even after analysis completed
- **Solution**: Fixed by properly matching completed results to pending tabs using `client_request_id`

### 6. **Error State Handling**
- **Problem**: Failed analyses would remove tabs entirely
- **Solution**: Now shows error state in tabs with visual feedback (error icon and message)

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes (app.js)
- Added unique `client_request_id` generation for each analysis submission
- Modified `processResults` to match by `client_request_id` instead of FIFO
- Added error state display for failed analyses
- Fixed cancel/interrupt logic to use specific request IDs
- Removed reliance on global `state.currentRequestId` for multi-request scenarios

### Backend Changes
- Updated `main.py` to echo `client_request_id` in queued and interrupted responses
- Modified `inference_service.py` to include `client_request_id` in completed and error responses
- Ensured all WebSocket messages preserve the client request ID throughout the request lifecycle

### Other Features Added
1. **Model/Layer Selection Explanation**: Added info box explaining within-group switching doesn't affect GPU/CPU or other users
2. **Model Refresh**: Added ability to reload model_groups.json without restarting backend
3. **New Model**: Added Gemma-3-27B-IT Chat L30 model to the configuration

## Testing Recommendations
1. Queue multiple analyses rapidly and verify they complete in correct tabs
2. Cancel/interrupt analyses while others are processing
3. Test error scenarios (e.g., invalid input) to verify error state display
4. Switch between tabs during analysis to ensure correct data association
5. Test with slow analyses to verify out-of-order completion handling
